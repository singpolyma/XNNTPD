= eXtensible NNTP Daemon (Server) =

This project aims to build a general-purpose, modular, and extendible NNTP server in Ruby.

This server will conform strictly to at least RFC3977.  Provided backends will conform to RFC5536 and RFC5537.

== Dependencies ==

* EventMachine
* EM-HTTP-Request
** Addressable
* Mail (use github.com/singpolyma/mail to remove activesupport dependency on 1.9)
* OpenPGP.rb (github.com/singpolyma/openpgp)
* Daemons (only if you want to daemonize)
* HTML2Markdown (if you use backends that store HTML only)
